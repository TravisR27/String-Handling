# String-Handling

Practical Task 1
Follow these steps:
● Create a file called alternative.py
● Write a program that reads in a string and makes each alternate
character into an upper case character and each other alternate character
a lower case character.
e.g. The string “Hello World” would become “HeLlO WoRlD”
● Now, try starting with the same string but making each alternative word
lower and upper case.
e.g. The string: “I am learning to code” would become “i AM learning
TO code”.
Tip: Using the split() and join() functions will help you here.
